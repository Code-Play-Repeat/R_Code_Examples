Ozone data set
Description of variables:

WSR_PK: continuous. peak wind speed
WSR_AV: continuous. average wind speed 

T_PK: continuous. Peak Temperature
T_AV: continuous. Average Temperature 

T85: continuous. T at 850 hpa level (or about 1500 m height) 
RH85: continuous. Relative Humidity at 850 hpa 
U85: continuous. U wind - east-west direction wind at 850 hpa
V85: continuous. V wind - north-south direction wind at 850 hpa
HT85: continuous. Geopotential height at 850 hpa, it is about the same as height at low altitude

HT50: continuous. 

KI: continuous. K-Index, a measure of thunderstorm potential
TT: continuous. T-Totals, an index used to assess storm strength
SLP: continuous. Sea level pressure 
SLP_: continuous. SLP change from previous day 

Precp: continuous. -- precipitation

Class: 0/1, 0=NOT ozone day
